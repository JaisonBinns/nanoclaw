Hey! I set up this awesome AI assistant that runs on my computer and I can message it from WhatsApp/Telegram 24/7. It's like having my own personal ChatGPT!

I made you a complete step-by-step guide to set up your own. Takes about 30-45 minutes and **you don't need any coding experience** - I walk you through every single command.

**Get the guide here:**
https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw/blob/main/docs/BEGINNER-SETUP-GUIDE.md

Or if you're already familiar with GitHub, just:
1. Go to https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw
2. Click on "docs" folder
3. Open "BEGINNER-SETUP-GUIDE.md"

The guide covers:
✅ Creating a GitHub account (step-by-step)
✅ Installing all the tools you need
✅ Setting up your AI assistant
✅ Connecting it to Telegram or WhatsApp
✅ Making it run automatically 24/7
✅ Troubleshooting if anything goes wrong

Everything is explained in plain English with "what this does" for every command.

It's really cool - I can:
- Schedule reminders
- Have it search the web for me
- Summarize my notes
- Set up recurring tasks
- And tons more

Let me know if you run into any issues! But the guide should cover everything.
